# FizzBuzzFREE
The free tier of my FizzBuzz. Some people like to see a FizzBuzz for (sic) "proof a programmer can program." If we're serious about discovering whether a programmer can program, just writing a function which computes FizzBuzz has not been enough for at least 10 years. The FizzBuzz should be performant, it should demonstrate a mathematician's research of modular arithmetic and use that for a performance improvement, and it should demonstrate parallelism. This free version demonstrates coroutines but it does not precompute a subset of FizzBuzz(Z+) with parallelism or implement the features I have or am developing for FizzBuzzPRO. It is presented for Android.
